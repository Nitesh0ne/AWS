	Types of EBS Volumes :
	 	General purpose= gpt2 and gp3, SDD , gpt2 default EBS volume
		provisioned IOPS = io1, io2 (high performance) ,SDD ,graphic
		throughput = st1 =HDD , frequently access data with cheaper price
		cold(sc1) = HDD = frequently access data with cheaper price
		Magnetic(standard) = previous generation ,

io1 and io2 can be attached to multiple ec2 instance at the same time in same AZ
 
IOPS = inout output per second 

2. INSTANCE STORE VOLUMES = temporary storage,  i,e if you stop and start the EC2 instance, Data is lost and deleted
		Emphemeral storage 

		Based on the instance type that yu have selected, instance store volumes will be attached automatically 

* on Reboot = Data of instance store will not  LOSS

2 Types of status check 
* Instance Status check =  Hardware check
