EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud 

Resizable = sclae in and scale out  => Elasticity
	    Scale up and scale down => Scalability



EC2 state = launch 
	    Running 
	    Stop 
            start 
            Reboot 
            Terminate = delete

EC2 is Regional 
pricing = Pay as you go model on hour basis

free 750 hours in month on first year 


On-Demand Instansces
 -> Fixed price 
 -> pay for what you have used
 -> pay per hour 
 -> No commitment
 -> No upfront payement
 -> No Predictable Usage


Reserved Instances

--> long term commitment == 1 to 3 years
--> upfront payement == full or partial payement
--> discount = (70-75)% discount
--> standart Reserved  = 75 % discount 
--> Convertiel Reserved = 
--> schedule Reserved = Reserved for a short time (fraction of day, week or month)


SPOT INSTANCES = 
Dedicated host =







EC2 Families/ Instance Type :

General Instances = For General purpose
Memory Instances  = If you need more memory for you application 
CPU Instances  = More CPU's

storage Instances = More storage 

GPU Instances = For heavy machines, Graphics,



Scalability can achieved by changing the instance type 
eg. t2.micro to t2.medium

if you change the instance type there is no data loss 
as data is stored in EBS volume 


Burstable Performance Instance = Billable

Ec2 instance will enter into the burstable mode and it give high 
performances for limited period of time only 


t2 and t3 types support bursstable instances
